							We finally made it to friday 2025! 
							<br><br>
							(I know the flight’s technically on saturday morning… don't come at me).
							<br><br>
							These cubes have a few purposes — but most importantly, they’re my way of teasing what’s to come on this trip.
							If you look closely, you might even guess some very important events 😉💍
							<br><br>
							Each day, you’ll be able to open a cube: revealing a story, a meme or a message from your loved ones — little reminders of those cheering us on, as we take our biggest step yet into the future we’ve dreamed of so many times.
							<br><br>
							Lastly, we’ll upload a photo each day so this space becomes a mosaic of our journey. Something we can always look back on and share.
							<br><br>
							I love you, always ❤️

							There were so many times where you would get mad at me because I was randomly sus and unresponive - I can now say 99% of the time it was either because I was designing a ring, organising the trip or most recently making this website. 
							<br><br>
							Every second of my time not spent with you, is spent thinking about you. I can't wait to experience this trip with you, but more importantly the rest of my life.

							Sim you should be so proud of yourself for going from the cringe girl at HSS to the one who bagged a baddie.
							<br><br>
							Prem despite the questionable circumstances of the early years of your "courtship" you honestly couldn't have picked somebody more perfect for you. I'm happy to admit Varun and I may have been wrong about this one 😔. 
							<br><br>
							Jokes aside I'm super happy for the both of you, and wish you both an incredible future. 
							<br><br>
							Enjoy the rest of your trip, can't wait to see the photos and hear about how it went! ⛩️🌸

The way he spoke about you was remarkable, he was slightly red and awkward too which was super cute. I knew you were going to be something special. 
							<br><br>
							Congratulations, so happy for you both! Selfishly however, I’m more excited for myself that I get that sister I never had, let alone one like you who I adore ☺️.

							Finding a place of peace and privacy in Japan during cherry blossom season, was near impossible.
							<br><br>
							At the foothills of Mt. Fuji, away from the hustle of the city, I wanted to capture the peace I feel when I'm with you. No matter how chaotic the world around us ever got, you have always been my constant. My happy place. 
							<br><br>
							Today, this place becomes part of our story. Our happy place ❤️
							<br><br>
							I don't have a video for you today. Instead I thought we could talk about all that lead us to this moment.

							<br><br>
							Hope you both are having the slayest time without your favourite third wheel and enjoying all the fabulous food. Super super happy and massive CONGRATULATIONS, excited for you both and can’t wait to celebrate with you when you get home (I’ll be waiting in the tv room and this time you won’t ruin my surprise 🤣😉).

						Dear Simran and Prem,

						Heartiest congratulations on your engagement! Simran, I am so incredibly proud of all your achievements, but most of all, I am overjoyed that you’ve found such a gem of a person in Prem. 
						<br><br>
						I have no doubt he will care for you deeply and support you every step of the way. And I know this for sure… because I saw ‘The Rock’ which is evidence that he is not he holding back🤑🤑🤑
						<br><br>
						Wishing you both a lifetime filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable memories.

						With all my love and blessings, Dad.

							<br><br>
							Prem, I'm so happy for you to have someone so special to share your life with. You deserve all the love, joy, and happiness ❤️💕💞 
							<br><br>
							Simran, I still remember the DML pizza night, I asked Prem about you, but he denied it, but I still told Deep about you. Somehow, I had that feeling that special girl had to be you 😃 I've known you since you were in Shishukunj, and I was your dance teacher. You've grown up to be a very confident and beautiful woman. 
							<br><br>
							Deep and I are so lucky to welcome you to our Aghera clan. Loads of blessings to you, with Love from Mum ❤️

							I probably spent more time designing the ring than I should have looking back on the vlogs. Not even sneaky editing could make those shots look flattering 😅 but I'm so happy with the way it turned out.
							<br><br>
							It was super important to me that the ring was perfect because it needed to reflect the way I have seen you since the day we met. I hope you look at the two little cherry blossoms years from now, reminded of this epic story that we wrote together ❤️
							<br><br>
							I can't wait for you to see it - one last thing to look forward to once the trip ends 😉

							I am sending all my love and heartiest congratulations to both of you. 
							<br><br>
							Simran, you're a beautiful, intelligent, kind and an amazing person, just like me 😉😉
							<br><br>
							I always knew you  had great taste, but i never expected you to find someone so brave enough to say yes. Prem has hit the jackpot (but trust me after seeing that ring and proposal in Japan so have you 😊). 
							<br><br>
							On a serious note, Prem is such an amazing person inside out and I have no doubt he will always be there for you in happy and sad moments. 
							<br><br>
							Cheers to a new beginning for both of you. Wishing you both a life full of happiness, love from Mum ❤️❤️

							The fact that I don't get to propose with the real ring is a bummer especially because the ring really is worth the hype.
							<br><br>
							I was so obsessed with it that I tried it on - now I think I am less sad about proposing with the dupe because then I can keep the real one 🤣.

							I always thought when the time came, I’d know exactly what to say. That the words would fall into place, like every other time I wrote to you (I mean I literally wrote 21 cards for your 21st birthday, how was a short 3 sentence speech HARDER?).
							<br><br>
							But everytime I sat down to think about what I wanted to say, my heart would race and tears would form.
							<br><br>
							Nothing I could say would ever even begin to remotely convey how much this day means to me - how long I've waited for it and for you.
							<br><br>
							I'm hoping I will have a speech ready by the time I do drop down on one knee. But something tells me I won't have anything.
							<br><br>
							It will probably feel like a blur, messy, with nerves written all over it but somehow, it feels more right than anything I could have ever rehearsed. Reminds me of the time I said I love you for the first time actually - oh boy.
