							We finally made it to friday 2025! 
							<br><br>
							(I know the flight‚Äôs technically on saturday morning‚Ä¶ don't come at me).
							<br><br>
							These cubes have a few purposes ‚Äî but most importantly, they‚Äôre my way of teasing what‚Äôs to come on this trip.
							If you look closely, you might even guess some very important events üòâüíç
							<br><br>
							Each day, you‚Äôll be able to open a cube: revealing a story, a meme or a message from your loved ones ‚Äî little reminders of those cheering us on, as we take our biggest step yet into the future we‚Äôve dreamed of so many times.
							<br><br>
							Lastly, we‚Äôll upload a photo each day so this space becomes a mosaic of our journey. Something we can always look back on and share.
							<br><br>
							I love you, always ‚ù§Ô∏è

							There were so many times where you would get mad at me because I was randomly sus and unresponive - I can now say 99% of the time it was either because I was designing a ring, organising the trip or most recently making this website. 
							<br><br>
							Every second of my time not spent with you, is spent thinking about you. I can't wait to experience this trip with you, but more importantly the rest of my life.

							Finding a place of peace and privacy in Japan during cherry blossom season, was near impossible.
							<br><br>
							At the foothills of Mt. Fuji, away from the hustle of the city, I wanted to capture the peace I feel when I'm with you. No matter how chaotic the world around us ever got, you have always been my constant. My happy place. 
							<br><br>
							Today, this place becomes part of our story. Our happy place ‚ù§Ô∏è
							<br><br>
							I don't have a video for you today. Instead I thought we could talk about all that lead us to this moment.

							<br><br>
							It was super important to me that the ring was perfect because it needed to reflect the way I have seen you since the day we met. I hope you look at the two little cherry blossoms years from now, reminded of this epic story that we wrote together ‚ù§Ô∏è

							The fact that I don't get to propose with the real ring is a bummer especially because the ring really is worth the hype.

							I always thought when the time came, I‚Äôd know exactly what to say. That the words would fall into place, like every other time I wrote to you (I mean I literally wrote 21 cards for your 21st birthday, how was a short 3 sentence speech HARDER?).
							<br><br>
							But everytime I sat down to think about what I wanted to say, my heart would race and tears would form.
							<br><br>
							Nothing I could say would ever even begin to remotely convey how much this day means to me - how long I've waited for it and for you.
							<br><br>
							I'm hoping I will have a speech ready by the time I do drop down on one knee. But something tells me I won't have anything.
							<br><br>
							It will probably feel like a blur, messy, with nerves written all over it but somehow, it feels more right than anything I could have ever rehearsed. Reminds me of the time I said I love you for the first time actually - oh boy.
